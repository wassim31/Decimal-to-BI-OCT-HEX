A simple Algorithm made with C programming language which Converts the decimal represnetation of a number to BINARY / OCTAL / HEXADECIMAL representation using the way of the devision.

In this program , I applied many tools and ways i learned the last month including : Optimization , Dynamic memory allocation (manipulating data segements) using the STDLIB.H's functions : Malloc and Free.

Some good simulation to understand how dynamic memory allocation works in C by (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
